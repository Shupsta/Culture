    An animated runner
    rudimentory scoring (which we wont use!)
    And a collection meter
    There is even temp sound & music!
        (right clicking on the webpage tab provides
        a convinient mute audio option)
    
    Bunkakai is basically Japanese for 
    Culuture Club (yeah that's not lost on me either) :P
    Currently there are three sceen areas
    Art, Fashion, and Music.
    The Bunkakai scene is there as an entry point.
